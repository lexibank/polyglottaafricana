[DV3] Code_Colonne	Com:Remarks. - There are three different Bága countries on the coast : the Kā́lum-Baga, to which Stephen belongs, the Rio-Pongas-Bagas, and the Rio-Nunez-Bagas. In the first two countries nearly the same language is spoken; but the Bagas of the Rio Nunez, I am informed, speak quite a different language, of which, however, I did not succeed in getting specimens, as these Bagas are not in the habit of coming to Sierra Leone, preferring to remain in a savage state and in lawless independence on their native hills. The Bagas opposite the Isles de Los are called Kū́ba by the Rio-Nunez-Bagas, whom, in return, they call Bága síntene, or Baheráka, i. e. “naked people,” their women being said to go entirely without clothes, and Kā́lum by the Rio-Pongas-Bagas. Kā́lum-Baga is west of Sṓlīma-Sóso, east of the Isles de Los, which they call Dōfútu or Fútu, North of Kábak, south of Labáia, a Sóso district which separates it from Rio-Pongas-Baga.

Túlun· is situate on the western part of the Búlom shore, which is inhabited by Búloms only, whereas in the eastern part Búloms and Tímnes are mixed. The Búloms of the Búlom shore call those of the Sherbro country Mámpa. These two Búlom countries are separated from each other by the Tímne territory, which extends right down to the east end of Sierra Leone.

[DV3] Code_Colonne	Com:Mā́mpūa, or Mámpa-Búlom, alias Sherbro. Remarks. - Mā́mpūa is situate west of Mẹ́nde, east of the sea between Sierra Leone and the Bum country. But the same language, with perhaps trifling modifications, is also spoken in Bum, which name is probably a contraction of Búlom. The Bum country intervenes between Búlom Proper, or Mā́pūa, and the Kirim country. The English name for “Sherbro,” which I suppose to be a corruption of “sea-bar,” pronounced “shea-bar,” there being a strong bar at the estuary of the Sherbro river. The Vei about Wā́koro and Dṣáiaro generally call the Mā́mpūa country Ṣī́ba, i. e. “sea-bar.”

[DV3] Code_Colonne	Com:Mánde, or Mandén·ga. Remarks.- He says that all Mandén·gas originally came from Mánde. Kā́ba is situate on the river Dṣḗlība, and is the capital of the Mánde country, which borders in the east on Bámbaran·, in the west on Dṣṓma, in the south on Dṣúman·ana, in the north on Búrē. In Dṣṓma and Dṣúman·ana the same language is spoken as in Mánde, but in Búrē the people speak similarly to the Sósos. This “Mandén·ga” has hitherto always been figuring on the maps as “Mandingo;” but this mode of spelling is incorrect : “n·ga” (very often pronounced “n·ka” ) is evidently a patronymic termination, as appears from its following proper names. The “a” of “n·ga” is an obtuse and abrupt ‘a’, entirely toneless, and pronounced just as, e.g., the infinitive termination ‘an’ is usually sounded in the Suabian Dialect of the German. The same perverse representation of this sound also occurs in the name Bága, which has been commonly written Bágo. The ‘i’ also is incorrect, as the natives plainly say Mánde and Mandén·ga, and not Mándi and Mandín·ga. Perhaps it is dificult for some English ears to observe the difference between ‘e’ and ‘i”, as I also find that the American Missionaries of Mẹnde have begun to spell this name Mendi, which is equally improper..

The situation of Mẹ́nde is west of Kọ́no and Kísi, east of Kā́rọ, i.e. Gallinas, and of Kī́mi, i.e. Kírim. The district joining on the Gallinas is called Nón·gōba; hence the Vei people often transfer this name to the whole Mẹ́nde tribe..

[DV3] Code_Colonne	Com:Dḗwoi·, in Monrovia, commonly called Dē. Remarks.- Dḗwoi· is the original name of the country about Monrovia, on the River St. Paul, which river is called Dḗ in the Dḗwoi· language. This tribe will probably soon cease to exist as such, and its language become extinct, it being already confined to the following five hamlets in the vicinity of Monrovia-Gbẹgbẹ̄́wīli, Blófu·, Kan·kámbīli, Nọ̄fọ́bli, and Kṓ?. The Liberian nationality being superior to, and more powerful than, that of the surrounding Pagan tribes, from its principles of Christianity and civilization, mill, in course of time, as this new negro republic becomes itself more consolidated and strengthened, probably absorb the nationality not only of Dḗwoi·, but also of Bása, Vei, and other tribes, a circumstance which the well-wisher of Africa has to hail with satisfaction rather than regret.

Igbḗgo is half a day's journey from Odā́fi, the Mā́ḥi capital, and three days east of Agbṓme, the Dahṓme capital. Bḗgo is about two hours' journey from the river Kósi, which comes from Nágūnu, i.e. Aku, and goes to Sáwālu, where it joins the river Úwọ and also three hours from Nyáwẹ, the Mā́ḥi capital (or chief town), which is situate on a mountain of the same name. The Mā́ḥians and Dahṓmeans are mortal enemies (Dósū· said, “They can never eat bread together, and do not like each other even in Sierra Leone” ), on account of the constant wars the latter wage against the former, and in four of which Dósū· had to encounter them. During the wars the Mā́ḥians take refuge in extraordinarily large caves of the mountains, with which the country abounds. One of the largest caves is that of the mountain Kẹ̄́guro. When Dósū· was still in his country, the Dahomeans had not any Amazons. They were only introduced in the reign of Gézu, the present king. Gézu's predecessor was Adálūsọ·.

But this appellation is liable to far greater objections than that of “Aku,” and ought to be forthwith abandoned ; for it is, in the first place, unhistorical, having never been used of the whole Aku nation by anybody, except for the last few years conventionally by the Missionaries ; secondly, it involves a twofold use of the word “Yórūba,” which leads to a confusion of notions, for in one instance the same word has to be understood of a whole, in another, only of part; and, thirdly, the name being thus incorrect, can never be received by the different tribes as a name for their whole nation. If, e.g., you call an Idṣébuan or a Yā́gban a Yórūban, he will always tell you, “Don't call me by that name, I am not a Yórūban ;” just, e.g., as the Wúrtembergians or Bavarians would never suffer themselves to be called Prussians.

But this appellation is liable to far greater objections than that of “Aku,” and ought to be forthwith abandoned ; for it is, in the first place, unhistorical, having never been used of the whole Aku nation by anybody, except for the last few years conventionally by the Missionaries ; secondly, it involves a twofold use of the word “Yórūba,” which leads to a confusion of notions, for in one instance the same word has to be understood of a whole, in another, only of part; and, thirdly, the name being thus incorrect, can never be received by the different tribes as a name for their whole nation. If, e.g., you call an Idṣébuan or a Yā́gban a Yórūban, he will always tell you, “Don't call me by that name, I am not a Yórūban ;” just, e.g., as the Wúrtembergians or Bavarians would never suffer themselves to be called Prussians.

Com:Remarks. - Pā́ti is the Bā́yon· capital, and is a town which cannot be traversed from end to end in one day. It is about one day's journey from the river Nèn, which comes from the Mbúrọn country in the west, and goes to the Lúfūm country, four weeks' journey east of Pā́ti, where it joins the large lake “Liba,” whose end “no man can see,” and whose mud is so sweet that the people considerit a great delicacy: this they obtain by thrusting down long, holIow, bamboosticks, and, after taking them up again, they pull out the mud which was forced into them. Pā́ti, probably a town or district, is situated west of Pálen· and Pákētu, where a different language is spoken, and which are separated from Pā́ti by the river Nèn ; east of Pápak, with a similar language, and Pámum, with a different language; north of Pā́ṛam, with a different language; south of Pā́mban, with a similar language. On his way to the sea, Yọn· passed through the countries Pán·gam, Yán·gam, Ndén·esōa, Lékọn·, Pátọ, Pā́n·ūan, Kón·wan·, áfek or Kálabā, The name “ Bā́yon·” is derived from a warlike and powerful king of the name of “Yon·,” who lived in Pā́ti, the capital of a country of the same name, and it is shared by the following towns and districts, aIl of which speak nearly the same language, Pámbān, Pā́n·gọt, Pā́pak, and Pálumfā. The Bā́yon· understand how to make very handsome mats and bags of grass, variously dyed. AIl the samples brought from Sierra Leone are made by them. They also weave cloth from cotton, which is about a foot in breadth. AlI the Bā́yon· and Rúfūm eat their enemies flesh in time of war. The Lúfūm people, who inhabit part of the shores of Lake Líbā, and to whose king Yọn· was once sent with an embassy to deliver a present consisting of salt, are tall, strong, and warlike, dressing in black monkey-skins, and fighting with swords, spears, and arrows. Near Lúfūm, and also on the shores of the Líbā, is another people called “Kěn·kọb,” only three or four feet high, but very stout, and the most excellent marksmen. They are peaceful, live on the produce of the chase, and are so liberal, that if, e.g., one has killed an elephant, he would give the whole of it away. Mókō : the natives of the following tribes are called Mókōs in Sierra Leone ; hence we retain this appellation for the whole family of their languages.

Com:Remarks. - Bánọn· is almost a days' journey from Ńtar, the Bā́gba capital, and three days from the large river Débẹ̄, also called Ríbā, in the Rífōm country. Bā́gba is situated west of Bandṣómbū, with a different language, and of Bán·kumbo, also with a different language ; east of Bā́dṣad, with the same language. It is also one day's journey from Bā́n·kon·, with the same language ; one from Bandṣẹ̄́mbi, with a different language ; two days from Bā́bu, with a different language ; two days from Bā́ko, also with a different language.

On the river Ríbā, which cornes from Bánsa, and goes to Bambón·go, and is not fordable on foot even in the dry season, there is a small tribe of people, only from three to five feet in height, called “Bétsan·,” who are most successful hunters. They get their cloth from the Nsṓr-trē by beating it flat and then drying it. They have long beards, and the hair of their head is about as long as a man's hand. They are a very peaceable people, never making war, and live entirely on the produce of the chase, sometimes exchanging their venison for millet, &c., in the Rúfūm country. They do not cultivate the ground, but are constantly on the move, changing their abode every six or twelve months. Their houses can be easily built, taken down, and even carried along with them, consisting as they do, of the bark of a large tree. The Bétsan· hunt monkeys, baboons, wild hogs, deer, elephants, &c.

Its width in some places is such that the opposite banks cannot be seen ; and where it is narrowest, it is so wide that a man on the opposite side appears as a child. It is in some places twenty fathoms deep, in others only four, inundating large tracts of land in the rainy season, and containing abundance of fish, alligators, and other large monsters, called nyámze (i.e. water-animal) and ndzū́enze. Pā́ṛam is situated west of Pā́pīak, near to which is Pā́mom, east of Pénām and Pẹ́ndām, with a different but cognate language; north of Pátī, also with a different but cognate language ; south of n·gọ̄́lān, with a different language.

Two years before he was kidnapped the T£ebāle had invaded his country and committed the most fearful atrocities ; e.g. they took children by their legs and dashed their brains out against trees ; ripped up the pregnant women ; caught four hundred children of the king's family and the families of other great men, made a large fire, and burnt them alive ; pulled out the eyes of people, and then let them go, &c. He added to this description, “black man bad for true ; white man no sappe (i.e. knows) how bad black man.” Mókō : the natives of the following tribes are called Mókōs in Sierra Leone ; hence we retain this appellation for the whole family of their languages.

Com:i.e. the language of the ʼPúlbē (i.e. Fúlbē) or ʼPū́Ia (i.e. Phū́la, Fū́la), is, by the Hausas called Fúlādṣi, and in plural Fúlāni, and by the Bọ́rnuese Fuláta. Remarks - ā́damu gave me the following particulars respecting Káno. The city has the following gates : 1. Kṓfar Wámbai, 2. Kṓfar Názarāwa, 3. Kṓfar Mā́ta, 4. Kṓfar Gándū, 5. Kṓfar Nalsa, 6. Kṓfar Āgúndi, 7. Kṓfar Gadún·kāya, 8. Kṓfar Kā́būga, 9. Kṓfar Wóika, 10. Kṓfar Adā́ma, 11. Kṓfar Lū́a, 12. Kṓfar Basū́gie, 13. Kṓfar Dūkā́wīa, and 14. Kṓfar Lẹ̄́mo. Káno is situated in a large sandy plain with two isolated mountains, viz. the “Dā́la” and the “Gólondūse”, about one hour's journey to the north-west of the town. Within the town is a large natron-containing lake (i. e. n·gása, plural gáse) called “Dṣákāra”, of about three miles in diameter ; so that, e.g., houses, but not men, are visible on the opposite shore. The lake contains no fish, but alligators ; and is three and a-half fathoms deep in the middle. Káno was wrested from the Hausas by the Fúlbē already under Fṓdīe, and now forms the residence of a Púlō governor, appointed from Sokoto. Particulars concerning the Phū́la, from the same : Púlō, in plural Fúlbē (perhaps with an additional form “Fū́la,” or rather “Phū́la”, or “Phū́la”), is properly an adjective, meaning “yellow”, “brown”, this being the complexion of the real Fúlbē or Phū́la ; hence the name “Phū́la” is in reality an appellative which has passed into a proper noun. The original home of the Fúlbē, as ā́damu learnt from another old Púlō in Freetown, was in Sílibāwa, near Fúta Tórō·, whose inhabitants are called Torón·ka, and were they had been often molested by Kafirs. To escape this molestation they went gradually towards the east ; in the capacity of Nomadic shepherds, tīl they arrived in Hausa. This seems to have happened in the eighteenth century of the Christian era. After they had been tending their cattle a long time in those forests and grassfields, without towns, and subsisting simply on the produce of their herds, one of their priests of the name of “Fṓdīe” had an apparition of the prophet Muhammad, which was destined to form a most signal epoch in the history of the Phū́la, and, indeed, in the history of the whole of Central and Western Africa. In this apparition Fṓdīe was informed that the whole of that beautiful country around them, with aIl its populous towns and countless villages, belonged to the believers in the prophet, to wit, the Phū́la ; and that it was Fṓdīe's divine commission, with the help of the faithful, to wrest aIl those flowery plains, those fruitful hills and lovely vallies, from the hand of the Kafir, and then to bring all the Kafirs into subjection to the Islam ; and to devote to the sword every one who refused to believe. Almost beside himself with enthusiasm, and burning with fanaticism, Fṓdīe summoned the believing Fúlbē from every country, to the very coast of the Atlantic, to rally round his banner, and to fight with him the battles of the prophet for the subjugation of aIl the Kafir tribes of Africa to the religion of God and his prophet. And, like an electric shock, this message of Fṓdīe pervaded all the lands where the Phū́la were sojourning, and with a magical power converted the shepherds into warriors. Soon Fṓdīe saw himself surrounded with an army convinced of its own invincibility and thirsting for the battle. Thus commenced, at the beginning of the present century, when in France Napoleon was preparing to shake Europe, those extraordinary Púlō movements in Central Africa, which, though unrecorded on the pages of our usual “Universal Histories”, are yet written in streams of blood on the pages of that real Universal History of our race, in which every human action records itself. On the spot where Fṓdīe had his apparition, he afterwards built the town Sókoto, which is now the great centre of Púlō power in Africa. There is also a saying, that when Muhammad came from Mecca on his camel, invisible of course, in order to appear to Fṓdīe, he halted on the mountain Dā́la, near Káno, and there performed his prayers. Now on the top of the Dā́Ia there is a rock, and in that rock certain cavities, and these cavities are the impress of the knees of Muhammad's camel, when he alighted, of the calabash which he used for the usual washing before prayer, and of Muhammad's own knees, hands, and forehead, as he prostrated himself in prayer to God. But whoever has doubts on this point had better go and examine for himself.

Com:Remarks - ā́dīrar is situated in the Zahā́ra sáhal, i.e. western desert, “sáhal” being the Bḗṛān word for the Arabic “mágarību”, about Cape Blanco. ā́gīlil is a five days' journey on a camel from Portendik, and three days from the sea. It is subject to Mū́lei ábd árraḥmān (i.e. Lord, servant of the merciful), king of Marā́kis, i.e. Morocco. Bḗṛān, called by the French “Lá Mōr”, is a large part of the desert, joining ā́dīrar in the east and south-east, and inhabited by the Nomadic and marauding Bḗṛān or Mōrs, who live in tents. Bḗṛān also borders on Bámbara.
