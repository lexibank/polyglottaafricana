I-A-1,Fúlup,band1340,Bandial,bqj,Africa,12.5258,-16.4245,Atlantic-Congo,Joola-Banjal,1,"Geographical remarks obtained from the same. - Bátēndu is half a day's journey from Kátọn·, the Fúlup capital, and about one mile distant from the sea. Fúlup is near Bándṣāl and Éṣin·, where the same language is spoken ; also near Búiui ; but a considerable distance, perhaps three weeks, from Elálāp, Bótirrẹt, and Sígidṣōt, in which four places the language is different from that of Fúlup. Sígidṣōt is inhabited by the Portuguese. The Fúlup country is quite level, without mountains and stones, the ground consisting of sand."
I-A-2,Fī́lham,jola1263,Jola-Fonyi,dyo,Africa,12.75752,-15.7354766667,Atlantic-Congo,Joola-Fogny,2,"Fī́lham or Fī́lhọ̄l. Remarks. - Búntun· is situate on a large river, running towards the sea, called Kṓya, and about three weeks' journey from the Gambia. Tórrāri is ten hours' journey from Búntun·, and six hours from the Bányūn frontier. The KKabún·ga call the Fī́lham Dṣṓla, or Fṓni Dṣṓla, i.e. perhaps, “ foreigner, barbarian.” The country of the Fī́lham tribe is called Ésuḥ, and is situated to the west of Kutẹ́n·o, with which it has one language in common."
I-B-1,Bṓla,mank1251,Mankanya,knf,Africa,12.2615066667,-15.74389,Atlantic-Congo,Mankanya,3,"Remarks. - Gṓle is situated in the Kō district, a few miles from the sea. Bṓla is called Burā́ma by the Bulánda and is situated west of Bulánda, north-east of Púlūnde, also near Bábōg·, Baṣẹ̄́rẹd, Kányōp, Káyū, Pósis, Bidṣṓgo."
I-B-2,Sárār,mand1419,Mandjak,mfv,Africa,12.829,-15.9217,Atlantic-Congo,Manjaku-Tame,4,"Remarks. - Sā́dal is about two hours' journey from Ámōn, the Sárār capital, and three hours from the sea. Sárār is situated west of Balánta, east of the sea, south of Bányūn, north of Bádṣūan or Dṣū́al, where the Bōla language is spoken."
I-B-3,Pẹ́pẹ̄l,pape1239,Papel,pbo,Africa,11.8977,-15.8388,Atlantic-Congo,Pepel,5,"Remarks. - Tōr is one day's journey from Ntḗ, the capital of the Biṣlā́o island.

I-C-1,Biā́fada,biaf1240,Biafada,bif,Africa,11.467,-15.1347,Atlantic-Congo,Biafada,7,"Remarks. - Tā́ba is a day and a-half's journey from the sea, and is situate on the river Basṣḗba; but Wākóra is four miles from the Badṣḗba. The Biā́fada are called Dsọṓla by the Kabún·ga; hence, also, by others, Biā́fada-Dsọṓla. Biā́fada is situate west of N·kā́bu, east of Bulánda, north of Nálu, south of Birā́su-Mandén·ga, where a language is spoken like that of the Kabún·ga."

I-D-1,Bága (of Kā́lum),baga1273,Baga Koga,bgo,Africa,10.1286,-13.947,Atlantic-Congo,Baga-Koba,9,"Remarks. - There are three different Bága countries on the coast : the Kā́lum-Baga, to which Stephen belongs, the Rio-Pongas-Bagas, and the Rio-Nunez-Bagas. In the first two countries nearly the same language is spoken; but the Bagas of the Rio Nunez, I am informed, speak quite a different language, of which, however, I did not succeed in getting specimens, as these Bagas are not in the habit of coming to Sierra Leone, preferring to remain in a savage state and in lawless independence on their native hills. The Bagas opposite the Isles de Los are called Kū́ba by the Rio-Nunez-Bagas, whom, in return, they call Bága síntene, or Baheráka, i. e. “naked people,” their women being said to go entirely without clothes, and Kā́lum by the Rio-Pongas-Bagas. Kā́lum-Baga is west of Sṓlīma-Sóso, east of the Isles de Los, which they call Dōfútu or Fútu, North of Kábak, south of Labáia, a Sóso district which separates it from Rio-Pongas-Baga."

I-D-3,Búlom,bull1247,Bullom So,buy,Africa,9.0,-13.16,Atlantic-Congo,Sei,11,"Búlom or North Búlom. Remarks. - The Búlom country, opposite Sierra Leone, borders on the Tímne country in the east and north. Túlun· is situate on the western part of the Búlom shore, which is inhabited by Búloms only, whereas in the eastern part Búloms and Tímnes are mixed. The Búloms of the Búlom shore call those of the Sherbro country Mámpa. These two Búlom countries are separated from each other by the Tímne territory, which extends right down to the east end of Sierra Leone."
I-D-4,Mámpa,sher1258,Sherbro,bun,Africa,7.77585,-12.7405,Atlantic-Congo,Sherbro,12,"Mā́mpūa, or Mámpa-Búlom, alias Sherbro. Remarks. - Mā́mpūa is situate west of Mẹ́nde, east of the sea between Sierra Leone and the Bum country. But the same language, with perhaps trifling modifications, is also spoken in Bum, which name is probably a contraction of Búlom. The Bum country intervenes between Búlom Proper, or Mā́pūa, and the Kirim country. The English name for “Sherbro,” which I suppose to be a corruption of “sea-bar,” pronounced “shea-bar,” there being a strong bar at the estuary of the Sherbro river. The Vei about Wā́koro and Dṣáiaro generally call the Mā́mpūa country Ṣī́ba, i. e. “sea-bar.”"
I-D-5,Kísi,sout2778,Southern Kisi,kss,Africa,8.32448,-10.3377,Atlantic-Congo,Southern Kisi,13,"Remarks. - Kísi is situate west and north of Gbándi, east of Mẹ́nde, south of Kọ́no. Pórūma is a town of the district Kámā.

II-1-a,Mandén·ga,mand1436,Mandinka,mnk,Africa,12.8165233333,-15.6539466667,Mande,Mandinka,14,"Mánde, or Mandén·ga. Remarks.- He says that all Mandén·gas originally came from Mánde. Kā́ba is situate on the river Dṣḗlība, and is the capital of the Mánde country, which borders in the east on Bámbaran·, in the west on Dṣṓma, in the south on Dṣúman·ana, in the north on Búrē. In Dṣṓma and Dṣúman·ana the same language is spoken as in Mánde, but in Búrē the people speak similarly to the Sósos. This “Mandén·ga” has hitherto always been figuring on the maps as “Mandingo;” but this mode of spelling is incorrect : “n·ga” (very often pronounced “n·ka” ) is evidently a patronymic termination, as appears from its following proper names. The “a” of “n·ga” is an obtuse and abrupt ‘a’, entirely toneless, and pronounced just as, e.g., the infinitive termination ‘an’ is usually sounded in the Suabian Dialect of the German. The same perverse representation of this sound also occurs in the name Bága, which has been commonly written Bágo. The ‘i’ also is incorrect, as the natives plainly say Mánde and Mandén·ga, and not Mándi and Mandín·ga. Perhaps it is dificult for some English ears to observe the difference between ‘e’ and ‘i”, as I also find that the American Missionaries of Mẹnde have begun to spell this name Mendi, which is equally improper.."

Remarks.- He says that, at Bisā́o, the population is a mixture of Pẹpẹls and Bulándas. Kā́bu is situate west of Pádṣāde, east of Bírāsu and Bisā́o, south of the Gambia and Súrū, i.e. Jólof, north-east of Biafáda, north of Kọ̄́li.

Remarks.- Tṓkin· is seven days journey east of Tímbo, the Fúta-Dṣálu capital. Fúta-Dṣálu is one month's journey in breadth and three in length, and was owned by the Dṣálu or Dṣalún·ga before the Phū́la conquest. Its situation is west of Bálīa, east of Támbaga, south of Buhndu, north of Sṓlīma, and the exclusive religion of its inhabitants is Muhammadanism.

Remarks.- Dḗwoi· is the original name of the country about Monrovia, on the River St. Paul, which river is called Dḗ in the Dḗwoi· language.

The Liberian nationality being superior to, and more powerful than, that of the surrounding Pagan tribes, from its principles of Christianity and civilization, mill, in course of time, as this new negro republic becomes itself more consolidated and strengthened, probably absorb the nationality not only of Dḗwoi·, but also of Bása, Vei, and other tribes, a circumstance which the well-wisher of Africa has to hail with satisfaction rather than regret."

The Mā́ḥians and Dahṓmeans are mortal enemies (Dósū· said, “They can never eat bread together, and do not like each other even in Sierra Leone” ), on account of the constant wars the latter wage against the former, and in four of which Dósū· had to encounter them. During the wars the Mā́ḥians take refuge in extraordinarily large caves of the mountains, with which the country abounds. One of the largest caves is that of the mountain Kẹ̄́guro. When Dósū· was still in his country, the Dahomeans had not any Amazons. They were only introduced in the reign of Gézu, the present king. Gézu's predecessor was Adálūsọ·."
III-C-1-a,(Akū) Ọ́ta,yoru1245,Yoruba,yor,Africa,7.15345,3.67225,Atlantic-Congo,Yoruba,42,"Ọ́tā. Remarks.- Elógbo is four hours' journey from 'Ọ́gmōle, the Ọ́tā capital. Ọ́tā is south of Ẹ̄́gba also borders on Ádō. N.B. Aku, or rather Ọ̄́ku, is a mode of salutation among all the tribes enumerated under No.1; and hence they are all of them designated in Sierra Leone “Akus,” not only by Europeans, but also and chiefly by the native population. It is, consequently, not the historical name by which these numerous tribes are united in one nation; but it is here retained because the historical name is not known at present. It may possibly be discovered, even if lost in the country itself, in one or another of the different appellations by which surrounding nations call the Akus. The Missionaries of the country ought to search after the proper national name of the whole Aku country. For the last few years they have very erroneously made use of the name “Yórūba” in reference to the whole nation, supposing that the Yórūban is the most powerful Aku tribe.

It may, however still be considered a problem, to be solved by future examination, whether the apparent affinity is original, or merely secondary, introduced by the intercourse of the ,Búdūmans with the Bọ́rnuese. If we compare the communication of my young informant with Búdūma specimens from other sources, we shall have a fair opportunity of forming an estimate concerning his power of recollection. It would be astonishing if his communications were quite correct."

It is about one day's journey from the river Nèn, which comes from the Mbúrọn country in the west, and goes to the Lúfūm country, four weeks' journey east of Pā́ti, where it joins the large lake “Liba,” whose end “no man can see,” and whose mud is so sweet that the people considerit a great delicacy: this they obtain by thrusting down long, holIow, bamboosticks, and, after taking them up again, they pull out the mud which was forced into them. Pā́ti, probably a town or district, is situated west of Pálen· and Pákētu, where a different language is spoken, and which are separated from Pā́ti by the river Nèn ; east of Pápak, with a similar language, and Pámum, with a different language; north of Pā́ṛam, with a different language; south of Pā́mban, with a similar language.

The Lúfūm people, who inhabit part of the shores of Lake Líbā, and to whose king Yọn· was once sent with an embassy to deliver a present consisting of salt, are tall, strong, and warlike, dressing in black monkey-skins, and fighting with swords, spears, and arrows. Near Lúfūm, and also on the shores of the Líbā, is another people called “Kěn·kọb,” only three or four feet high, but very stout, and the most excellent marksmen. They are peaceful, live on the produce of the chase, and are so liberal, that if, e.g., one has killed an elephant, he would give the whole of it away.

They are a very peaceable people, never making war, and live entirely on the produce of the chase, sometimes exchanging their venison for millet, &c., in the Rúfūm country. They do not cultivate the ground, but are constantly on the move, changing their abode every six or twelve months.

XII-C-6-d,(Púlō) Káno,nige1253,Hausa States Fulfulde,fuv,Africa,10.9972,11.1188,Atlantic-Congo,Fula (Kano-Katsina-Bororo),170,"i.e. the language of the ʼPúlbē (i.e. Fúlbē) or ʼPū́Ia (i.e. Phū́la, Fū́la), is, by the Hausas called Fúlādṣi, and in plural Fúlāni, and by the Bọ́rnuese Fuláta. Remarks - ā́damu gave me the following particulars respecting Káno. The city has the following gates : 1. Kṓfar Wámbai, 2. Kṓfar Názarāwa, 3. Kṓfar Mā́ta, 4. Kṓfar Gándū, 5. Kṓfar Nalsa, 6. Kṓfar Āgúndi, 7. Kṓfar Gadún·kāya, 8. Kṓfar Kā́būga, 9. Kṓfar Wóika, 10. Kṓfar Adā́ma, 11. Kṓfar Lū́a, 12. Kṓfar Basū́gie, 13. Kṓfar Dūkā́wīa, and 14. Kṓfar Lẹ̄́mo. Káno is situated in a large sandy plain with two isolated mountains, viz. the “Dā́la” and the “Gólondūse”, about one hour's journey to the north-west of the town. Within the town is a large natron-containing lake (i. e. n·gása, plural gáse) called “Dṣákāra”, of about three miles in diameter ; so that, e.g., houses, but not men, are visible on the opposite shore. The lake contains no fish, but alligators ; and is three and a-half fathoms deep in the middle. Káno was wrested from the Hausas by the Fúlbē already under Fṓdīe, and now forms the residence of a Púlō governor, appointed from Sokoto. Particulars concerning the Phū́la, from the same : Púlō, in plural Fúlbē (perhaps with an additional form “Fū́la,” or rather “Phū́la”, or “Phū́la”), is properly an adjective, meaning “yellow”, “brown”, this being the complexion of the real Fúlbē or Phū́la ; hence the name “Phū́la” is in reality an appellative which has passed into a proper noun. The original home of the Fúlbē, as ā́damu learnt from another old Púlō in Freetown, was in Sílibāwa, near Fúta Tórō·, whose inhabitants are called Torón·ka, and were they had been often molested by Kafirs. To escape this molestation they went gradually towards the east ; in the capacity of Nomadic shepherds, tīl they arrived in Hausa. This seems to have happened in the eighteenth century of the Christian era. After they had been tending their cattle a long time in those forests and grassfields, without towns, and subsisting simply on the produce of their herds, one of their priests of the name of “Fṓdīe” had an apparition of the prophet Muhammad, which was destined to form a most signal epoch in the history of the Phū́la, and, indeed, in the history of the whole of Central and Western Africa. In this apparition Fṓdīe was informed that the whole of that beautiful country around them, with aIl its populous towns and countless villages, belonged to the believers in the prophet, to wit, the Phū́la ; and that it was Fṓdīe's divine commission, with the help of the faithful, to wrest aIl those flowery plains, those fruitful hills and lovely vallies, from the hand of the Kafir, and then to bring all the Kafirs into subjection to the Islam ; and to devote to the sword every one who refused to believe. Almost beside himself with enthusiasm, and burning with fanaticism, Fṓdīe summoned the believing Fúlbē from every country, to the very coast of the Atlantic, to rally round his banner, and to fight with him the battles of the prophet for the subjugation of aIl the Kafir tribes of Africa to the religion of God and his prophet. And, like an electric shock, this message of Fṓdīe pervaded all the lands where the Phū́la were sojourning, and with a magical power converted the shepherds into warriors. Soon Fṓdīe saw himself surrounded with an army convinced of its own invincibility and thirsting for the battle. Thus commenced, at the beginning of the present century, when in France Napoleon was preparing to shake Europe, those extraordinary Púlō movements in Central Africa, which, though unrecorded on the pages of our usual “Universal Histories”, are yet written in streams of blood on the pages of that real Universal History of our race, in which every human action records itself. On the spot where Fṓdīe had his apparition, he afterwards built the town Sókoto, which is now the great centre of Púlō power in Africa. There is also a saying, that when Muhammad came from Mecca on his camel, invisible of course, in order to appear to Fṓdīe, he halted on the mountain Dā́la, near Káno, and there performed his prayers. Now on the top of the Dā́Ia there is a rock, and in that rock certain cavities, and these cavities are the impress of the knees of Muhammad's camel, when he alighted, of the calabash which he used for the usual washing before prayer, and of Muhammad's own knees, hands, and forehead, as he prostrated himself in prayer to God. But whoever has doubts on this point had better go and examine for himself."
